## Creating an Instance and an Autoscaling Group/ Load Balancer:

First we enter our aws account then select `instances` then select `Launch Templates`, then we select `Create launch template`
 We choose the following settings:

name and tags: `name-group-ASG-1`
We enter the same for the description as above:
we then tick the box for `Provide guidance to help me set up a template that I can use with EC2 Auto Scaling`
We then select our operating system which is `Ubuntu 18.04 LTS`
make sure we choose the correct key pair for us devops-tech201

then`Default VPC`

instance type: `t2 micro`
Key pair: `devops ...`

auto assign IP: Enable.

Select security group option:

choose name belal-tech201-app

Secruity group rule select SSH and MY IP.

Secruity group rule 2 select HTTP and anywhere.

Security group rule 3 Custom TCP and anywhere.

Configure storage 8 GB is enough for us as we have little data.

then we go to `advance` and where it says `User data` at the bottom we enter the following bash commands so ngingx is automatically run.

`#!/bin/bash`
`sudo apt update -y`
`sudo apt upgrade -y`

`sudo apt install nginx -y` 
`sudo systemctl restart nginx`
`sudo systemctl enable nginx`

If we made any mistakes in the above command it will not work and it will have to be done manually, on Git Bash.

then select `Create launch template`

After this we will launch our Auto Scaling group:

On the bottom left of the AWS page we will find `Auto Scaling Groups` the click create an `Launch configurations` the click `Create Launch Configuration` 
then we choose our name for our `auto scaling group` then we select our template which is the one we made previous to this step. 
Then we click `next` We keep our default VPC, then we select our 3 availability zone 1A,1B and 1C
then we select `next` then we select `attach to a new load balancer` and we choose `Application Load Balancer`(ALB)
then we select `internet facing`
then we select `create a target group` in the listners and routing section and leave it on port 80
then we select `ELB` in the health check option
then we go to the next page
then select desired size:2
maximum size:
maximum capacity:3 
then we select `target tracking policy`

In default it will monitor the CPU Utilizationbwhen it reaches 50 it will automatically create a new instance using autoscaling. Select `next`
Add notification - select `next`
`Add tags` - this is important s there will be 2 so we need to no which is which, then `Create auto scaling group`.
Now we simply and copy and past the URL and we should have nginx running on both instances on different URL's

### Creating and Auto Scaling Group for our APP:














## Autoscaling and load balancer (policies, target groups, template, ALB)

AWS Auto Scaling is a service that assists organizations in supervising AWS-based software and infrastructure. The service automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. 

AWS Auto Scaling can increase and/or decrease the capacity of AWS services to optimize costs. The service will monitor all scalable cloud services and resources related to a userâ€™s applications

### What is load balancing?

High-traffic applications and websites can serve thousands of users internationally each day. Load balancing describes the process of distributing workload evenly across multiple servers. A load balance sends requests to servers that can efficiently handle them to optimize speed and performance while preventing downtime.

For a long time, load balancers existed in the form of hardware in private data centers. However, thanks to the popularization of the cloud, load balancers have evolved. You may hear them referred to as application delivery controllers (ADCs).

They now provide additional capabilities such as security, acceleration, and authentication. In the context of Amazon EC2, a load balancer will distribute traffic among EC2 instances. The load balancer will spread a load across multiple downstream instances while exposing only a single point of access (DNS) to your application. Additionally, the load balancer will perform regular health checks on instances to ensure they are working correctly.


### Autoscaling Policy:

In Simple Autoscaling Policy, you define the threshold value and upper bound. The alarm monitors the metric values. When the metric value breaches the threshold, the scaling policy acts. The instances are added or removed as per the policy. The Amazon Web Services has modified the Autoscaling Policies and new features have been introduced. It now lets you scale in and scale out your instances in percentage terms of the running instances. You can now define multiple scaling policies in a single AutoScaling Policy based on your metric values. Below is an example of an Auto scaling policy.

### What is target group in Auto Scaling?
Target Groups: Target group is used to route network traffic via specified protocols and ports to specified instances and also to allow accessing many applications running on different ports but the same instance. Autoscaling Group: Autoscaling Group(ASG) is basically a group of identical instances.

### AWS Autoscale using a template:

- Create an Auto Scaling group using a launch template:

When you create an Auto Scaling group, you must specify the necessary information to configure the Amazon EC2 instances, the Availability Zones and VPC subnets for the instances, the desired capacity, and the minimum and maximum capacity limits.

To configure Amazon EC2 instances that are launched by your Auto Scaling group, you can specify a launch template or a launch configuration. The following procedure demonstrates how to create an Auto Scaling group using a launch template.

To update the configuration of the EC2 instances after the group is created, you can create a new version of the launch template. After you change the launch template for an Auto Scaling group, any new instances are launched using the new configuration options, but existing instances are not affected. To update the existing instances, terminate them so that they are replaced by your Auto Scaling group, or allow auto scaling to gradually replace older instances with newer instances based on your termination policies

Before you can create an Auto Scaling group using a launch template, you must create a launch template with the parameters required to launch an EC2 instance. These parameters include the ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and an instance type.

A launch template provides full functionality for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and also newer features of Amazon EC2 such as the current generation of Amazon EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes (io2), EBS volume tagging, T2 Unlimited instances, Elastic Inference, and Dedicated Hosts.

### What is an ALB load balancer?
Application Load Balancer components

A load balancer serves as the single point of contact for clients. The load balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones. This increases the availability of your application.



In this diagram below we can get a visual sense of how Auto scaling and a load balancer will work together, aautoscaling will adjust the amount of compute power and load balancer will distrubute EC2 instance so no one instance is overwhelmed.

Launch an instance
With On-Demand Instances, you pay for compute capacity by the second (for Linux, with a minimum of 60 seconds) or by the hour (for all other operating systems) with no long-term commitments or upfront payments. Launch an On-Demand Instance from your launch template.

Launch instance from this template

Create an Auto Scaling group from your template
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability and allows you to scale your Amazon EC2 capacity up or down automatically according to conditions you define. You can use Auto Scaling to help ensure that you are running your desired number of Amazon EC2 instances during demand spikes to maintain performance and decrease capacity during lulls to reduce costs.

Create Auto Scaling group

Create Spot Fleet
A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts, you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. The hourly price for a Spot Instance (of each instance type in each Availability Zone) is set by Amazon EC2, and adjusted gradually based on the long-term supply of and demand for Spot Instances. Spot instances are well-suited for data-analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and optional tasks.
